\title{Evaluate Signal Quality}
\usage{
evaluate_signal_quality(signal, pressure_start_point)
}
\arguments{
\item{signal}{A numeric vector representing the signal.}

\item{pressure_start_point}{The starting point of the pressure.}
}
\value{
A numeric score indicating the quality of the signal.
}
\description{
This function evaluates the quality of a provided signal based on specific criteria.
}
\details{
The function applies both basic and advanced filters to evaluate the signal's quality.
The basic filter checks for conditions related to peaks, minimums, variance, and range.
The advanced filter performs checks on stabilization and drop rates.
}
\examples{
sample_signal <- rnorm(40)
start_point <- 5
quality_score <- evaluate_signal_quality(sample_signal, start_point)
}
