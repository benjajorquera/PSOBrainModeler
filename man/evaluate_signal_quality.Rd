\title{Signal Quality Evaluation}
\usage{
evaluate_signal_quality(
  signal,
  pressure_start_point = 3L,
  silent = TRUE,
  max_diff_threshold = 0.55
)
}
\arguments{
\item{signal}{A numeric vector representing the signal.}

\item{pressure_start_point}{(Optional) The starting point of the pressure.
Defaults to 3L.}

\item{silent}{(Optional) A logical indicating whether to run the function
silently (without printouts). Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{max_diff_threshold}{(Optional) A numeric value representing the
maximum difference threshold. Defaults to 0.55.}
}
\value{
A list with a numeric score indicating the quality of the signal and
  the result of the evaluation.
}
\description{
Evaluates the quality of a provided signal based on specific criteria,
including advanced tests complementing the basic filter. This function is
designed to work with signals at a frequency of 2 Hz.
}
\details{
The function evaluates the signal's quality using a set of criteria,
  starting with advanced tests before applying the basic filter. The function
  returns a score of 0 for any failed test and 1 if all tests are passed.

Advanced Criteria:
1. Maximum Difference Test: Checks if the maximum distance between any two
 consecutive points in the signal exceeds 0.55.
 This test helps in identifying sudden spikes or drops in the signal,
 indicating potential anomalies.
2. Stationarity Test: Uses the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to determine if
 the signal is stationary.
 A non-stationary signal (p-value >= 0.05) might indicate trends or seasonal
 effects, which could affect the model's performance.

Basic Filter Checks:
1. Global minimum (peak) should occur between 3 and 9 seconds after the
 pressure start point.
2. The minimum peak of the signal should be between -0.2 and 0.5.
3. Variance of the signal should be less than 0.002 between seconds 15 and 30
 (stabilization tail).
4. The maximum and minimum values of the entire signal should be between
 -0.2 and 1.2 (exclusive).

The function returns a score of 0 for any failed test and 1 if all tests are
 passed.
