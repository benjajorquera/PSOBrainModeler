silently (without printouts). Defaults to TRUE.}

maximum allowed value for the first derivative. Defaults to 0.55.}

maximum allowed value for the second derivative. Defaults to 0.30.}

A list with a numeric score indicating the quality of the signal and
  the result of the evaluation.

\description{
Evaluates the quality of a provided signal based on specific criteria,
including advanced tests complementing the basic filter. This function is
designed to work with signals at a frequency of 2 Hz.
}
\details{
The function evaluates the signal's quality using a set of criteria,
  starting with advanced tests before applying the basic filter. The advanced
  tests involve checking the first and second discrete derivatives of the signal
  against their respective thresholds. These tests help identify sudden spikes
  or drastic changes in the signal's trend, indicating potential anomalies.

Advanced Criteria:
1. First Derivative Test: Checks if the maximum absolute value of the first
   discrete derivative of the signal exceeds the first_derivative_threshold.
2. Second Derivative Test: Checks if the maximum absolute value of the second
   discrete derivative of the signal exceeds the second_derivative_threshold.

Basic Filter Checks:
1. Global minimum (peak) should occur between 3 and 9 seconds after the
   pressure start point.
2. The minimum peak of the signal should be between -0.2 and 0.5.
3. Variance of the signal should be less than 0.002 between seconds 15 and 30
   (stabilization tail).
4. The maximum and minimum values of the entire signal should be between
   -0.2 and 1.2 (exclusive).

The function returns a score of 0 for any failed test and 1 if all tests are
 passed.
